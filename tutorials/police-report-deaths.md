## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll create and style multiple individual plots in the Chart Studio, add them to a dashboard, and utilize the crossfilter function to interact and explore these data further.

## 1. Data

To get started, head to Plotlyâ€™s [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. For this tutorial, we'll use the Police Killings dataset from the [FiveThirtyEight](http://bit.ly/237YWtv).
Simply, copy the URL (https://plot.ly/~public.health/17.csv) or open the [dataset](https://plot.ly/~public.health/17/) and click **'Fork & Edit'** to begin.

If you choose the latter, the Chart Studio ought to have opened and you're all set to go. If the former, navigate to the [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and click **'Import'**, **'By URL'**, and then paste in the **URL** (https://plot.ly/~public.health/17.csv).

## 3. Create a Dashboard

With the charts completed and saved in your [home folder](https://plot.ly/organize/home), we can now create a dashboard by simply adding these charts, adjusting the layout, and styling the dashboard before sharing and interacting. To get started with creating a dashboard, hover over the *+Create* button and select **Dashboard** from the menu. Alternatively, open this [link](https://plot.ly/dashboard/create).

### 3.1. Add Charts



### 3.2. Style It



Congrats, your dashboard is complete! Click **Save** on in the bottom right-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all), or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with), or **Private** (visible only to you) and hit **Save**. .
