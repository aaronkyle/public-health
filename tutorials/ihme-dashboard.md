# Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Dashboard

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll create and style multiple individual plots in the Chart Studio, add them to a dashboard, and utilize the crossfilter function to interact and explore health indicators on a global scale. The data comes from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), which is based in Seattle, Washington, USA.

## 1. Data

To get started, head to Plotlyâ€™s [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. For this tutorial, we'll use data from the IHME in Seattle.

Simply, copy the URL (https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/8914) or click [**'Fork & Edit'**](https://plot.ly/create/?fid=Dreamshot:8914). If you choose the latter, the Chart Studio ought to have opened and you're all set to go. If the former, navigate to the [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and click **'Import'**, **'By URL'**, and then paste in the **URL**.

## 2. Create a Chart

To visualize international health metrics, we'll create six individual charts: (1) a choropleth map to illustrate worldwide healthy life expectancy, (2) a choropleth map to illustrate the prevalence of high risk alcohol consumption, (3) a choropleth map to illustrate daily smoking prevalence, (4) a bubble chart that examines the relationship between overweight prevalence and health life expectancy, (5) a bubble chart that examines the relationship between high risk alcohol consumption and healthy life expectancy, and (6) a bubble chart that examines the relationship between daily smoking prevalence and healthy life expectancy. In this section we'll look at how to make each of the charts.

### 2.1. Healthy Life Expectancy Choropleth Map

##### 2.1.1. Create
Now that we have the data added to the grid, we can select our chart type. To do so, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Choropleth** from the *Maps* column.

Now to populate the map with data, in the *Locations* and *Values* dropdown select **Country Code** and **HALE**, respectively. Additionally, for the *Location Format* the **Country Abbreviations (ISO-3)** option should be selected.

##### 2.1.2. Region and Projection
While we're still in the *Create* tab, we can try out a few different *Map Regions* and *Projections*. Since our data is global, we selected the *Map Region* **World** and *Projection* **Natural Earth**. 

![Select Region and Projection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.1.2.png)

##### 2.1.3. Traces
Now that we have finished choosing the region and projection, click *Traces* to style your map. There are a host of *Colorscales* to choose from. For this particular map, we chose the second colorscale from the left.

![Choose Colorscale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.1.3.png)

##### 2.1.4. Layout
Next, navigate to the *Layout* tab to set the margins. To set the margins, select the *Margins and Padding* box and enter the values **0, 0, 0, 0, 0**, respectively.

![Set Margin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.1.4.png)

##### 2.1.5. Color Bars
Finally, you can style the color bar by navigating to *Color Bars*. For this tutorial, we've decided to **Hide** the *Color Bars* on each map because the data speaks for itself. 

![Hide Colorbar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.1.5.png)

##### 2.1.6. Save
Congrats, your chart is complete! Click **Save** on the left-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all) or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with) and hit **Save**. Since these plots are destined for a dashboard, they can't be set to private.

### 2.2. Alcohol Consumption Choropleth Map

##### 2.2.1. Create
As demonstrated earlier, the first step is to select our chart type. To do so, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Choropleth** from the *Maps* column.

Like the previous map, to populate it with data: in the *Locations* and *Values* dropdown select **Country Code** and **Drinking**, respectively. Additionally, for the *Location Format* the **Country Abbreviations (ISO-3)** option should be selected.

![Create Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.2.1.png)

##### 2.2.2. Region and Projection
While we're still in the *Create* tab, we can try out a few different *Map Regions* and *Projections*. Since our data is global, we selected the *Map Region* **World** and *Projection* **Distance Preserving (Equirectangular)**. 

![Select Region and Projection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.2.2.png)

##### 2.2.3. Traces
Now that we have finished choosing the region and projection, click *Traces* to style your map. As noted earlier, there are a host of *Colorscales* to choose from. For this particular map, we chose the sixth colorscale from the left. Next, we set the *Colorscale Range* to *Min Value* **1** and *Max Value* **20**.

![Choose Colorscale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.2.3.png)

### 2.3. Smoking Choropleth Map

##### 2.3.1. Create
First off, let's select our chart type. To do so, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Choropleth** from the *Maps* column.

Like before, to populate the map with data: in the *Locations* and *Values* dropdown select **Country Code** and **Smoking**, respectively. Additionally, for the *Location Format* the **Country Abbreviations (ISO-3)** option should be selected.

![Create Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.3.1.png)

##### 2.3.2. Region and Projection
As we've seen from earlier maps, you can try out a few different *Map Regions* and *Projections* in the *Create* tab. Since our data is global, we selected the *Map Region* **World** again and *Projection* **Globe (Orthographic)** this time. 

![Select Region and Projection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag/2.3.2.png)

### 2.4. Overweight Prevalence and Healthy Life Expectancy Bubble Chart

##### 2.4.1. Create
As usual, we will select our chart type first. We'll move on from the choropleth maps now to see if we can uncover any relationships in the data. To do so, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Scatter plot** from the *Business* column.

![Create Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/public-health/master/screencasts/IHME/tut_imag_2/2.4.1.png)

To populate this chart with data, for the *X* axis data select **HALE**, for the *Y* axis data select **Obesity**, for the *Hover Text* option select **Country**, for the *Size* option select **Population**, and for the *Color* option pick **Obesity**.

##### 2.4.2. Layout
Before styling the traces we'll first adjust the font size. Hence, navigate to *Layout* under *Style*. Here, open the *Title and Fonts* box and select **20** for the *Title* font size and **14** for the *Global Font* size. For this plot, we'll leave the rest of the layout as is. Now, in the *Margins and Padding* box, enter the values **0, 20, 35, 0, 0**, respectively.

## 3. Create a Dashboard

With the charts completed and saved in your [home folder](https://plot.ly/organize/home), we can now create a dashboard by simply adding these charts, adjusting the layout, and styling the dashboard before sharing and interacting. To get started with creating a dashboard, hover over the *+Create* button and select **Dashboard** from the menu. Alternatively, open this [link](https://plot.ly/dashboard/create).

### 3.1. Add Charts

Before adding a chart, we'll add a text box to describe the dashboard and its uses. Simply, click the *Text* button, where a text editor ought to appear. In the text editor, add the text you wish to display in the dashboard.



Now to add the scatter plot, click *+Plot* in the bottom left corner of the screen. A new box ought to appear with the option to 'Add a Plot'. Click, the *'Your Files'* option and then in the pop-up select the **scatter plot** we made earlier. Now, you ought to see the plot added to your dashboard. Next, in the top left corner of the box where it says, "Enter a title..." insert **"California measles cases, colored by week of year"**.



Repeat the process for the boxplot and 3D scatter plot we made earlier, but title them **"California measles cases by week of year"** and **"California measles cases: Week of year versus Year versus Cases"**, respectively.



### 3.2. Style It

Now that we have the structure of our dashboard, we can style it. To do so, navigate to the *settings icon* directly opposite the dashboard title. When hovering you ought to see the option settings from the menu. After clicking *settings*, a panel ought to appear from the right-hand side of the screen. Here, we have the option of headers, colors, text, layout, and filter.



First, in *Headers*, we can set the title, add a logo, and multiple links. For this tutorial, add **"Measles Cases in California 1928-2004"** to the *Title* text box. Next, let's add the Project Tycho logo. We can do this by simply adding the URL for the logo PNG: **https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/images/web3.png**. As previously mentioned you can add links, in this tutorial we'll use this feature to link the original dataset. Thus, add the text **"Data Source: Project Tycho Level 1 data"** with the URL: **https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/data/level1.php**.



In the next tab, *Colors*, we can manipulate the background, borders, and text colors. As you can see, the dashboard has already added these by default. Thus, for this tutorial, we'll leave them as is.



*Text*, the third settings option, allows you to control all things text, including font color, family, and size, as well as header styles and text box styles. Again, like the Colors tab, some values are defined. However, here, we'll set the *Font Family* to **Raleway**. Make the header font larger by selecting **2.2em** in the *Header Font Size* and, additionally, change the *Header Font Weight* to **300**. Lastly, to separate the text box, set the *Text Box Background Color* to **#FFFFFF**.



In *Layout*, you have the option of setting the page layout as either a dashboard or a report. Here, we'll leave it as the default dashboard setting. The last settings category, *Filter*, provides you with the option to enable or disable the Search Bar or the Crossfilter feature. For this tutorial, leave the *Search Bar* as is but lets enable the **Crossfilter** feature by selecting **enable** (for more information about this feature see the next section).



Congrats, your dashboard is complete! Click **Save** on in the bottom right-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all), or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with), or **Private** (visible only to you) and hit **Save**. .
