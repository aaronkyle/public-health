## 1. Data

To get started, head to Plotlyâ€™s [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. For this tutorial, we'll use the Motor Trend Car Road Tests dataset from the [1974 Motor Trend US magazine](https://gist.github.com/omarish/5687264).

In this dashboard, each of the six plots have been made with a unique dataset. That is, one plot to one dataset. Therefore, we have taken the above dataset and created 6 unique sub-datasets. Below, is table of the plot / sub-dataset associations:

| Plot | Dataset |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Car Model Bar Chart | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2395/  |
| Mpg vs Cylinder Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2385/ |
| Hp vs Acc Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2381/ |
| Hp vs Disp Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2405/  |
| Weight vs Hp Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2384/  |
| Weight vs Acc Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2382/  |


## 2. Create a Chart

To visualize Motor Trend Car Road Tests 1970-71, we'll create six individual charts: (1) a horizontal bar chart of miles per gallon (mpg) by car model, (2) a scatter plot of mpg vs cyclinders, and a further four scatter plots composed of different variables: horsepower vs acceleration, horsepower vs displacement, weight vs horsepower, and weight vs acceleration. As previously mentioned, the main intention of these charts is that they are each created from a unique dataset.

### 2.1. Car Model Bar Chart

##### 2.1.1. Create
Now that we have the data in the grid, we can select our chart type. To do so, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Bar Chart** from the *Business* column.

![Chart Type](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/chart-type.png)

Next, we can populate the graph by selecting **mpg** and **name** in the *x* and *y* dropdowns. You ought to see a bar chart like below

![Trace Values](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/trace-values.png)

##### 2.1.2. Traces
Now that the graph is populated, we can look to style it. Thus, under the *Style* tab select *Traces*. Since we want to make a horizontal bar chart, we cab simply click **Horizontal** and magic is done for us. In this tutorial were going to style the markers / traces black thus set the *Fill* to **#000000**. To prevent any clutter we alter the *Size and Spacing* by setting the *Bar Width* to **70** and *Padding* to **10**.

![Trace Styles](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/trace-styles.png)

##### 2.1.3. Layout
Moving on to the *Layout*, we will set our background color. Here, set the *Plot* and *Margin Color* to **F0F0F0**.

![Canvas](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/canvas.png)

Next, open *Title and Fonts* and in *Global Font* set the *Typeface* to **Raleway** and *Size* to **10**. We'll use a smaller font size due to the volume of text on the y axis.

![Global Font](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/global-font.png)

Again, due to the text on the y axis, select the *Margins and Padding* box
and enter the values **0, 20, 150, 10, 0**, respectively. This ought to have provided you with something similar to below.

![Margins](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/margins.png)

##### 2.1.4. Axes

## 3. Create a Dashboard

With the charts completed and saved in your [home folder](https://plot.ly/organize/home), we can now create a dashboard by simply adding these charts, adjusting the layout, and styling the dashboard before sharing and interacting. To get started with creating a dashboard, hover over the *+Create* button and select **Dashboard** from the menu. Alternatively, open this [link](https://plot.ly/dashboard/create).

### 3.1. Add Charts
First, to add the pie chart, click *+Plot* in the bottom left corner of the screen. A new box ought to appear with the option to 'Add a Plot'. Click, the *'Your Files'* option and then in the pop-up select the **Car Model Bar Chart** we made earlier.

![Add Bar Chart](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-pie-chart.png)

Next, add the scatter plot immediately below following the same process.

![Add Scatter Plot](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-scatter-plot.png)

Like previously, add the choropleth map following the same process. This time drag and drop the plot on the right half of the scatter plot.

![Add Choropleth](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-choropleth.png)

Now that we have added all the plots to the dashboard, for each plot where it says "Enter a title..." insert plot titles: **Miles Per Gallon by Car Model**, **Mpg vs Cylinder**, **Displacement vs Horsepower**, **Acceleration vs Horsepower**, **Horsepower vs Weight**, and **Acceleration vs Weight**, respectively. Your result ought to look like below.

![Add Plot Titles](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-plot-title.png)

### 3.2. Style It

Now that we have the structure of our dashboard, we can style it. To do so, navigate to the *settings icon* directly opposite the dashboard title. When hovering you ought to see the option settings from the menu.

![Settings](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/settings.png)

After clicking *settings*, a panel ought to appear from the right-hand side of the screen. Here, we have the option of headers, colors, text, layout, and filter. First, in *Headers*, we can set the title, add a logo, and multiple links. For this tutorial, add **Motor Trend Car Road Tests 1970-71** to the *Title* text box. Now, lets add a link to the original dataset. by add the text **Data Source: mtcars** with the URL: **https://gist.github.com/omarish/5687264**.

![Header](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/header.png)

In the next tab, *Colors*, we can manipulate the background, borders, and text colors. As you can see, the dashboard has already added these by default. That said, for this dashboard we will set *Header Background* to **#000000**, *Header Font Color* to **#FFFFFF**, *Page Background*, *Box Background*, and *Box Header Background* to **#F0F0F0**. Lastly, enter **#000000** as the *Box Border* and *Box Header Font Color*.

![Colors](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/colors.png)

*Text*, allows you to control all things text, including font color, family, and size, as well as header styles and text box styles. Again, like the *Colors* tab, some values are defined. However, here, we'll set the *Font Color* to **#000000** and *Font Family* to **Raleway**. Set the header font to **1.6em** in the *Header Font Size* and, additionally, change the *Header Font Weight* to **300**. We can leave the remainder as-is.

![Text](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/text.png)

In *Layout*, you have the option of setting the page layout as either a dashboard or a report. Here, we'll leave it as the default dashboard setting. The last settings category, *Filter*, provides you with the option to enable or disable the Search Bar or the Crossfilter feature. For this tutorial, **enable** both *Search Bar* and the *Crossfilter* feature (for more information about this feature see the next section). Now, like below, you ought to see a search bar and filter dropdown appear below the dashboard header.

![Filter](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/filter.png)

Congrats, your dashboard is complete! Click **Save** on in the bottom right-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all), or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with), or **Private** (visible only to you) and hit **Save**. .

![Save](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/save.png)

## 4. Crossfilter

Crossfilter is a visual analysis technique for multidimensional data. It is used to clarify relationships between dimensions. As discussed in the previous section, crossfilter functionality is invoked by setting **enable** in Settings > Filter.

To use crossfilter, simply click-and-drag on a chart. Selected data that shares common rows with other charts will highlight and all other data will fade out. To reset the dashboard, click anywhere on a graph that doesn't have data.
