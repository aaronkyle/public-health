# Motor Trend Car Road Tests 1970-71

In this tutorial, we'll create and style multiple individual plots from separate datasets in the Chart Studio, add them to a dashboard, and utilize the crossfilter feature to interact and explore these data further. The main purpose of this dashboard is to show that you can create a crossfilter dashboard with plots that have different grids, so long as the grids have the same number of rows.

## 1. Data

To get started, head to Plotlyâ€™s [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. For this tutorial, we'll use the Motor Trend Car Road Tests dataset from the [1974 Motor Trend US magazine](https://gist.github.com/omarish/5687264).

In the created dashboard, each of the six plots have been made with a unique dataset. That is, one plot to one grid. Therefore, we have taken the above dataset and created 6 unique subsets. Below, is a table of the plot / dataset associations:

| Plot | Dataset |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Car Model Bar Chart | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2395/  |
| Mpg vs Cylinder Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2385/ |
| Hp vs Acc Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2381/ |
| Hp vs Disp Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2405/  |
| Weight vs Hp Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2384/  |
| Weight vs Acc Scatter Plot | https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2382/  |


## 2. Create a Chart
To visualize Motor Trend Car Road Tests 1970-71, we'll create six individual charts: (1) a horizontal bar chart of miles per gallon (mpg) by car model, (2) a scatter plot of mpg vs cyclinders, and a further four scatter plots composed of different variables: (3) horsepower vs acceleration, (4) horsepower vs displacement, (5) weight vs horsepower, and (6) weight vs acceleration. As previously mentioned, the main intention of these charts is that they are each created from a unique dataset.

### 2.1. Car Model Bar Chart
Using the [Car Model Bar Chart grid](https://plot.ly/~bdun9/2395/), open the data in the Chart Studio.

##### 2.1.1. Create
Now that we have the data in the grid, we can select our chart type. To do so, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Bar Chart** from the *Business* column.

![Chart Type](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/chart-type.png)

Next, we can populate the graph by selecting **mpg** and **name** in the *x* and *y* dropdowns. You ought to see a bar chart like below

![Trace Values](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/trace-values.png)

##### 2.1.2. Traces
Now that the graph is populated, we can look to style it. Thus, under the *Style* tab select *Traces*. Since we want to make a horizontal bar chart, we cab simply click **Horizontal** and magic is done for us. In this tutorial were going to style the markers / traces black thus set the *Fill* to **#000000**. To prevent any clutter, we alter the *Size and Spacing* by setting the *Bar Width* to **70** and *Padding* to **10**.

![Trace Styles](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/trace-styles.png)

##### 2.1.3. Layout
Moving on to the *Layout*, we will set our background color. Here, set the *Plot* and *Margin Color* to **F0F0F0**.

![Canvas](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/canvas.png)

Next, open *Title and Fonts* and in *Global Font* set the *Typeface* to **Raleway** and *Size* to **10**. We'll use a smaller font size due to the volume of text on the y axis.

![Global Font](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/global-font.png)

Again, due to the text on the y axis, select the *Margins and Padding* box
and enter the values **0, 20, 150, 10, 0**, respectively. This ought to have provided you with something like below.

![Margins](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/margins.png)

##### 2.1.4. Axes
Now that we've finished with the *Layout*, navigate to *Axes* where *Titles* ought to be open already. Set *x* to **Mpg** and *Font Size* **12** before removing the *y* title.

![Axes Titles](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/axes-titles.png)

Next, open *Lines*, *All*, and select **Hide** for all options.

![Lines](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/lines.png)

Finally, select *Zoom Interactivity* and click **Disable**.

![Zoom](../screencasts/mtcars/mpg-vs-name/zoom.png)

##### 2.1.5. Save

## 3. Create a Dashboard

With the charts completed and saved in your [home folder](https://plot.ly/organize/home), we can now create a dashboard by simply adding these charts, adjusting the layout, and styling the dashboard before sharing and interacting. To get started with creating a dashboard, hover over the *+Create* button and select **Dashboard** from the menu. Alternatively, open this [link](https://plot.ly/dashboard/create).

### 3.1. Add Charts
First, to add the Car Model Bar Chart, click *+Plot* in the bottom left corner of the screen. A new box ought to appear with the option to 'Add a Plot'. Click, the *'Your Files'* option and then in the pop-up select the **Car Model Bar Chart** we made earlier.

![Add Bar Chart](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-plot.png)

Next, add the **Mpg vs Cylinder Scatter Plot** using the same process but drag and drop this one on the right-hand side of the horizontal bar chart.

![Add Mpg vs Cyl](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-plot2.png)

Like previously, add the **Horsepower vs Displacement Scatter Plot**. This time drag and drop the plot on the bottom half of the previous scatter plot.

![Add Hp vs Disp](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-plot3.png)

And again for **Weight vs Horsepower Scatter Plot**. .

![Add Wt vs Hp](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-plot4.png)

Add, **Horsepower vs Acceleration Scatter Plot**. This time drag and drop on the right-hand side of the middle row (hp vs disp). Confirm with the image below.

![Add Hp vs Disp](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-plot5.png)

Similarly, place **Weight vs Acceleration Scatter Plot**. on the right-hand side of the bottom row (weight vs hp). Now, you ought to have a dashboard like below.

![Add Wt vs Hp](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-plot6.png)

Now that we have added all the plots to the dashboard, for each plot where it says, "Enter a title..." insert plot titles: **Miles Per Gallon by Car Model**, **Mpg vs Cylinder**, **Displacement vs Horsepower**, **Acceleration vs Horsepower**, **Horsepower vs Weight**, and **Acceleration vs Weight**, respectively. Your result ought to look like below.

![Add Plot Titles](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/add-plot-titles.png)

### 3.2. Style It

Now that we have the structure of our dashboard, we can style it. To do so, navigate to the *Settings Icon* directly opposite the dashboard title. When hovering you ought to see the option **Settings** from the menu.

![Settings](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/settings.png)

After clicking **Settings**, a panel ought to appear from the right-hand side of the screen. Here, we have the option of *Headers*, *Colors*, *Text*, *Layout*, and *Filter*. First, in *Headers*, we can set the title, add a logo, and multiple links. For this tutorial, add **Motor Trend Car Road Tests 1970-71** to the *Title* text box. Now, lets add a link to the original dataset. Add the text **Data Source: mtcars** with the URL: **https://gist.github.com/omarish/5687264**.

![Header](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/header.png)

In the next tab, *Colors*, we can manipulate the background, borders, and text colors. As you can see, the dashboard has already added these by default. That said, for this dashboard we will set *Header Background* to **#000000**, *Header Font Color* to **#FFFFFF**, *Page Background*, *Box Background*, and *Box Header Background* to **#F0F0F0**. Lastly, enter **#000000** as the *Box Border* and *Box Header Font Color*.

![Colors](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/colors.png)

*Text*, allows you to control all things text, including font color, family, and size, as well as header styles and text box styles. Again, like the *Colors* tab, some values are defined. However, here, we'll set the *Font Color* to **#000000** and *Font Family* to **Raleway**. Set the header font to **1.6em** in the *Header Font Size* and, additionally, change the *Header Font Weight* to **300**. We can leave the remainder as-is.

![Text](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/text.png)

In *Layout*, you have the option of setting the page layout as either a dashboard or a report. Here, we'll leave it as the default dashboard setting. The last settings category, *Filter*, provides you with the option to enable or disable the Search Bar or the Crossfilter feature. For this tutorial, leave the *Search Bar* as-is but letâ€™s activate the *Crossfilter* feature by selecting **Enable** (for more information about this feature see the next section).

![Filter](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/filter.png)

Congrats, your dashboard is complete! Click **Save** on in the bottom right-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all), or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with), or **Private** (visible only to you) and hit **Save**. .

![Save](../screencasts/mtcars/dashboard/save.png)

## 4. Crossfilter
Finally, we'll briefly demonstrate crossfilter.

**Crossfilter** is a visual analysis technique for multidimensional data. It is used to clarify relationships between dimensions. As discussed in the previous section, crossfilter functionality is invoked by setting **enable** in Settings > Filter.

To use crossfilter, simply click-and-drag on a chart. Selected data that shares common rows with other charts will highlight and all other data will fade out. To reset the dashboard, click anywhere on a graph that doesn't have data.
