## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll create and style multiple individual plots in the Chart Studio, add them to a dashboard, and utilize the crossfilter function to interact and explore these data further.

## 1. Data

To get started, head to Plotlyâ€™s [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. For this tutorial, we'll use the 3W Dataset on the Organizations Involved in the Response to the Ebola Crisis dataset from the [Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDE)](http://bit.ly/2zq86Mh).
Simply, copy the URL (https://plot.ly/~jackp/18129.csv) or open the [dataset](https://plot.ly/~jackp/18129/) and click **'Fork & Edit'** to begin.

![Fork and Edit](../screencasts/aid-agency/satellite/fork-and-edit.png)

If you choose the latter, the Chart Studio ought to have opened and you're all set to go. If the former, navigate to the [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/create/) and click **'Import'**, **'By URL'**, and then paste in the **URL** (https://plot.ly/~jackp/18129.csv).

## 2. Create a Chart

To visualize aid agencies during the Ebola outbreak, we'll create four individual charts: (1) a satellite map to illustrate aid agency location, (2) a pie chart indicating aid agency activity, (3) another pie chart looking at countries, and (4) a bar chart highlighting the total activity by relief organizations. In this section we'll look at how to make each of the charts.

### 2.1. Satellite Map

##### 2.1.1. Create
Now that we have the data added to the grid, we can select our chart type. To do so, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Satellite Maps** from the *Maps* column.

![Chart Type](../screencasts/aid-agency/satellite/chart-type.png)

Now to populate the graph with data, in the *Latitude* and *Longitude* dropdown select **Lat** and **Lon**, respectively. Additionally, add **Region** in the *hover text* dropdown to display region names on hover.

![Trace Values](../screencasts/aid-agency/satellite/trace-values.png)

##### 2.1.2. Layout
Now that the map is populated with scatter points, navigate to the *Layout* to fix the map positioning and map style to help focus in on the data points. Open the *Map Style* box and select **Light** from the dropdown menu to change the map to a lighter style.

![Map Style](../screencasts/aid-agency/satellite/map-style.png)

Next, click *Map Positioning* to adjust the center and zoom of the map. Set *Center Latitude* to **8.5**, *Center Longitude* to **-10**, and *Zoom Level* to **5.4**. The map now ought to display West Africa.

![Map Positioning](../screencasts/aid-agency/satellite/map-position.png)

To make the map the full width and height, open *Margins and Paddings* and set all the values to **0**.

![Margins](../screencasts/aid-agency/satellite/margins.png)

##### 2.1.3. Traces
With our layout styled, navigate to the *Traces* tab to style the data points. Here, set the color to **#000000**, *Diameter* to **16**, and **select / tick all values** in the *Values Shown on Hover*.

![Trace Values](../screencasts/aid-agency/satellite/trace-styles.png)

##### 2.1.4. Save
Congrats, your chart is complete! Click **Save** on the left-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all) or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with) and hit **Save**. Since these plots are destined for a dashboard, they can't be set to private.

![Save](../screencasts/aid-agency/satellite/save.png)

### 2.2. Pie Chart (Activities)

##### 2.2.1. Create
Again, now that we have the data in the grid, we can select our chart type. To do so, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Pie Chart** from the *Business* column.

![Chart Type](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-activity/chart-type.png)

Next, we can populate the graph by selecting **Activity** in the *Labels* dropdown. You ought to see a pie chart with a legend like below.

![Trace Values](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-activity/trace-values.png)

##### 2.2.2. Traces
To style the pie chart, we can make changes to the text, colors, borders, and order. To do so, navigate to the *Traces* tab under *Style*. Here, **select Label** and **unselect %**, change the *Typeface* to **Raleway**, set the *Slice Order* to **Clockwise**, and the *Rotation* to **130 degrees**. Additionally, to make the slices more defined set the *Border Width* to **1**.

![Trace Styles](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-activity/trace-styles.png)

##### 2.2.3. Legend
With the styling done and the option to use labels directly on the slices the legend on the right-hand side is redundant. Thus, click *Legend* under *Style* and select **Hide**.

![Legend](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-activity/legend.png)

##### 2.2.4. Save
Congrats, your chart is complete! Click **Save** on the left-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all) or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with) and hit **Save**. Since these plots are destined for a dashboard, they can't be set to private.


![Save](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-activity/save.png)

### 2.3. Pie Chart (Countries)

##### 2.3.1. Create
Like the previous pie chart, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and **Pie Chart** from the *Business* column.

![Chart Type](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-countries/chart-type.png)

Populate the graph by selecting **Country** in the *Labels* dropdown. You ought to see a pie chart with a legend like below.

![Trace Values](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-countries/trace-values.png)

##### 2.3.2. Traces
To style the pie chart, we can make changes to the text, colors, borders, and order. To do so, navigate to the *Traces* tab under *Style*. Here, **select Label, Value, and %**, change the *Typeface* to **Raleway**, and the *Rotation* to **120 degrees**. Additionally, to make the slices more defined set the *Border Width* to **1**.

![Trace Styles](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-countries/trace-styles.png)

##### 2.3.3. Legend
With the styling done and the option to use labels directly on the slices the legend on the right-hand side is redundant. Thus, click *Legend* under *Style* and select **Hide**.

![Legend](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-countries/legend.png)

##### 2.3.4. Save
Congrats, your chart is complete! Click **Save** on the left-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all) or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with) and hit **Save**. Since these plots are destined for a dashboard, they can't be set to private.

![Save](../screencasts/aid-agency/pie-chart-countries/save.png)


### 2.4. Bar Chart

##### 2.4.1. Create
After loading the data, select *Graph* on the left-hand side, then *Create*. Click *Chart Type*, and select **Bar Chart** from the *Business* column.

![Chart Type](../screencasts/aid-agency/bar-chart/chart-type.png)

Now, you ought to see *y*, *x*, and *Hover Text* dropdowns. Select **Lat**, **Organisation**, and **Org type**, respectively.

![Trace Values](../screencasts/aid-agency/bar-chart/trace-values.png)

##### 2.4.2. Aggregate
As we are wanting to display the total count for each organization, under *Graph* click *Aggregate*. Next, click the blue *+ Agreggate* button. In the box that appears, select **Organisation** as the *Group By Column*. Set *Trace* to **Lat**, *x* to **first**, and aggregate *y* by **count**.

![Aggregate](../screencasts/aid-agency/bar-chart/aggregate.png)

##### 2.4.3. Layout
Now that our data display the total count for each organization, we can style the layout. More specifically, the margins. Navigate to *Layout*, open *Margins and Paddings* and set the values to **0, 400, 20, 0, 0**, respectively.

![Margins](../screencasts/aid-agency/bar-chart/margins.png)

##### 2.4.4. Axes
With the margins adjusted and the x axis tick labels visible, select *Axes* under *Style* to style the tick labels. First, however, open the *Titles*, select *All* and **remove all titles**.

![Axes Titles](../screencasts/aid-agency/bar-chart/axes-titles.png)

To style the tick labels, open *Tick Labels* and set the *Typeface* to **Raleway** and *Angle* to **90 degrees**. This is to ensure that the tick labels always stay at 90 degrees.

![Tick Labels](../screencasts/aid-agency/bar-chart/tick-labels.png)

Lastly, for this bar chart, at the bottom of *Axes* open the *Zoom Interactivity* box, select *All* and **Disable**.

![Zoom](../screencasts/aid-agency/bar-chart/zoom.png)

##### 2.4.5. Save
Congrats, your chart is complete! Click **Save** on the left-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all) or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with) and hit **Save**. Since these plots are destined for a dashboard, they can't be set to private.

![Save](../screencasts/aid-agency/bar-chart/save.png)

## 3. Create a Dashboard

With the charts completed and saved in your [home folder](https://plot.ly/organize/home), we can now create a dashboard by simply adding these charts, adjusting the layout, and styling the dashboard before sharing and interacting. To get started with creating a dashboard, hover over the *+Create* button and select **Dashboard** from the menu. Alternatively, open this [link](https://plot.ly/dashboard/create).

### 3.1. Add Charts



### 3.2. Style It



Congrats, your dashboard is complete! Click **Save** on in the bottom right-hand side of the screen. In the pop-up, enter your filename and select either **Public** (visible to all), or **Private Link** (visible only to those who you share the link with), or **Private** (visible only to you) and hit **Save**. .
