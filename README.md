## Crossfilter Overview

Crossfilter is a visual analysis technique for multidimensional data. It is used to clarify relationships between dimensions.

To use crossfilter, simply click-and-drag on a chart in one of the linked plot.ly dashboards below. Selected data that shares common rows with other charts will highlight and all other data will fade out. To reset the dashboard, click anywhere on a graph that doesn't have data.

To make crossfilter dashboards in plot.ly, make sure each dashboard chart is made from the same dataset. Once your dashboard is constructed, enable crossfilter under Settings > Filter. Follow one of the tutorials linked below for a full and illustrated guide to this workflow.

![ebola-outbreak-dashboard](https://github.com/plotly/public-health/raw/master/screencasts/ebola_outbreak.png)

## Pro Tips

Here are a few Pro Tips when creating crossfilter dashboards on Plot.ly:

1. To enable crossfilter in Plot.ly dashboards, make sure that all graphs in the dashboard are made from the same dataset and that crossfilter is enabled in the Filter tab of Dashboard Settings. 
If dashboard plots are made from multiple datasets and crossfilter is enabled, Plotly will attempt to merge them if all datasets have the same number of rows. If you intend to build a crossfilter dashboard from multiple datasets and cannot merge them in a data preparation tool beforehand, make sure that the datasets are the same length and sorted in the same order.
2. Right-click (or Ctrl-click) on the Plot.ly spreadsheet for a menu of data preparation tools including:
	1. Convert dates to Plotly date format
		- E.g. **December 10, 2016 -> 12-10-2016**
 	2. Find... Replace
 	3. Merge 2 or more columns with a delimiter
 		- E.g. **| December | 10 | â†’ December-10**
 	4. Merge week of year and year columns into Plotly date format
  		- E.g. **| 48 | 2016 | â†’ 12-28-2016**
 	5. Convert **state name** to **state abbreviation** (for use in choropleth maps)
  		- E.g. **Vermont â†’ VT**
 	6. Cumulative sum
 	7. Sometimes you will still have to prep datasets before plotting using a tool like Google Sheets, Python, or R
3. Raw CSV links on GitHub such as [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/.../mpg.csv](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/omarish/5687264/raw/7e5c814ce6ef33e25d5259c1fe79463c190800d9/mpg.csv) can be imported directly into Plot.ly from the the "URL" tab of the Import tool.
4. You can access the dataset behind a dashboard plot by:
	1. Selecting "View Plot" under the cog menu in the upper-right corner of the plot
	2. On the plot page, select the "Sources" tab. "Sources" is a tree view of the data sources that make up a plot. The data sources can be created by the author of the plot or a different Plot.ly user.
	3. In the tree view, the root nodes on the left side are the datasets that make up the plot. Click on them to go to the home page for the dataset.
5. Use the [Plotly modebar](https://help.plot.ly/getting-to-know-the-plotly-modebar/) in the upper-right corner of dashboard plots to change the cursor mode between hover, zoom, and panning states. The modebar can also download a PNG image of plots.
6. Disable default zoom in dashboard plots to prevent users from accidentally zooming as they scroll through your dashboard. You can disabled zoom for your plot under **Axes â†’ Zoom Interactivity** inside [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/online-chart-maker/).
7. Minimize the ink-to-data ratio: Make plots minimalistic or they will be overwhelming when combined in a dashboard.

## Crossfilter for Data Scientists and Programmers

If you know how to program in R, Python, or JavaScript, you likely do not need a crossfilter GUI such as [Plotly Dashboards](https://plot.ly/dashboards-and-reports/) or Tableau. Instead, you can use Plotly graphics and a crossfilter engine written in R, Python, or JavaScript crossfilter engine. We recommend using [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) for Python, Shiny for R, and [crossfilter.js](https://github.com/square/crossfilter) for JavaScript. Here are 3 simple public health crossfilter examples in each language:

- **Python/Dash**: Zika Outbreak
	- App: https://zika-crossfilter.herokuapp.com/
	- Code: https://github.com/charleyferrari/zika-crossfilter/
- **R/Shiny**: Zika Outbreak
	- Code: https://github.com/cpsievert/zikar
- **JavaScript/crossfilter.js**: World Bank Health Indicators
	- App: https://plotly.github.io/plotly.js-crossfilter.js/
	- Code: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js-crossfilter.js

## Roadmap

2018 work on Plotly and Plotly.js support for crossfilter will fall under 3 broad categories:

### 1. Crossfilter support for all Plotly.js chart types

Not all of Plotly.js charts currently support interactive data selection via the mouse. Without a drilldown tool for selecting  data, a chart cannot initiate crossfilter inside a dashboard. These charts are listed under *"Charts without data selection"* in the table below below.

Some charts have a data selection tool, but are not yet wired into the crossfilter program in Plot.ly dashboards. These charts, listed under *"Charts not yet connected to crossfilter on Plot.ly"*, will not respond to crossfilter selection inside dashboard. 

In 2018 we'll continue to add data selection and crossfilter responsivity across :100: of Plotly.js charts.

| Violin plots                    |                               |                                                       |

[Related Plotly.js issues](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/milestone/25)

### 2. Optimizing Plotly.restyle and Plotly.addTraces speed

Crossfilter on Plot.ly currently works by:

1. Listening for a data selection event
2. Sending the selected data to [crossfilter.js](https://github.com/square/crossfilter) for processing
3. Updating all graphs on the dashboard with a combination of [Plotly.restyle](https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/#plotlyrestyle) and [Plotly.addTraces](https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/#plotlyaddtraces)

In order to achieve subsecond dashboard updates with crossfilter, [Plotly.restyle](https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/#plotlyrestyle) and [Plotly.addTraces](https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/#plotlyaddtraces) will need to be optimized.

[Related Plotly.js issues](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/1850)

### 3. Open-source plotly.js-crossfilter library

The Plotly.js crossfilter wrapper written for Plot.ly dashboards will be documented and published on NPM for so that Web developers can build Tableau-style dashboards without getting bogged down in the low level interfaces of [crossfilter.js](https://github.com/square/crossfilter), [Plotly.restyle](https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/#plotlyrestyle), and [Plotly.addTraces](https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/#plotlyaddtraces).
