## Crossfilter Overview

Crossfilter is a visual analysis technique for multidimensional data. It is used to clarify relationships between dimensions.

To use crossfilter, simply click-and-drag on a chart in one of the linked plot.ly dashboards below. Selected data that shares common rows with other charts will highlight and all other data will fade out.

To make crossfilter dashboards in plot.ly, make sure each dashboard chart is made from the same dataset. Once your dashboard is constructed, enable crossfilter under Settings > Filter. Follow one of the tutorials linked below for a full and illustrated guide to this workflow.
